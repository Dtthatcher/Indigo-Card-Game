# Indigo-Card-Game

This is a project from JetBrains Academy.

I think it does a good job of showing basic OOP principles

The game is simple:

A deck, dealer, cardpile, human player, npc, and Game are created.

The dealer shuffles the deck, then places 4 cards face up on table and deals each player 6 cards.

The objective is to place down a card that matches either the top cards Suit or Rank. 
When succesful you get all the cards in the pile.
When all players have an empty hand, the dealer deals 6 more cards.

10 - A all have a point value of 1, and whoever has the most cards at the end of the game gets a bonus 3 points.

Whoever starts the game also gets any remaining cards on the table when the final card from each players hand is placed.

Enjoy and hope this helps!!
